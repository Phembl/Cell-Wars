Move ideas for Cell Wars

1. Simple Expansion

Rules: Each player cell converts adjacent neutral cells to that player's color
Strategy: Good for expanding from edges or filling gaps
Visual Pattern: Blooms outward in all directions

2. Spiral Growth

Rules: Cells activate in a spiral pattern from the center
Strategy: Good for penetrating deep into opponent territory
Visual Pattern: Creates a spiral arm that can wrap around obstacles

3. Checkerboard Pattern

Rules: Creates alternating cells in a checkerboard configuration
Strategy: Covers more area but with less density
Visual Pattern: Alternating cells that can later be filled in

4. Line Sweeper

Rules: Creates a line that moves across the board, converting cells in its path
Strategy: Good for cutting through opponent territory
Visual Pattern: A line that pushes forward, potentially changing direction

Competitive Elements
The competitive aspect of Cell Wars comes from:

Strategic Placement: Choosing where to start your automaton
Move Selection: Picking the right pattern for the current board state
Timing: Some moves might be more effective early vs. late game
Counter-Play: Certain patterns might be good at disrupting opponent patterns

Patterns with randomness:

1. Snake Pattern

Basic Concept: Similar to the game Snake, creates a winding path
Random Element: At each growth step, there's a 25% chance to change direction
Rules:

Begin growth in a random direction from starting cell
Continue in same direction until random direction change occurs
Never backtrack (can't go opposite of current direction)
Can potentially cross its own path


Strategy: Unpredictable penetration into enemy territory, good for creating long, thin corridors
Visual Effect: A winding, snake-like pattern that's different each time

2. Root Growth

Basic Concept: Mimics how plant roots or lightning branches spread
Random Element: Random branching probability and direction
Rules:

Start with a "trunk" growing from the seed cell
Each cell has a 15-30% chance to spawn a branch in a random direction
Branches can themselves branch further, creating complex networks
Each branch has diminishing probability to spread as it gets further from origin


Strategy: Good for creating networks that can surround and isolate opponent territories
Visual Effect: Organic-looking tendrils spreading across the board

3. Explosive Growth

Basic Concept: A cellular explosion that's denser near the center
Random Element: Probability of cell activation decreases with distance
Rules:

Cells near the center have higher probability (e.g., 80-100%) of being captured
Probability decreases with distance from the center
Creates random "holes" in the pattern for organic look


Strategy: Creates a strong central base with unpredictable outer boundary
Visual Effect: Looks like an explosion or splash with random droplets at the edges

4. Viral Spread

Basic Concept: Models how a virus might spread through a population
Random Element: Each cell has random "infection power"
Rules:

Adjacent cells have highest chance of infection
Some rare "super-spreader" cells can infect cells at a distance
Creates clusters with varying density


Strategy: Unpredictable coverage that might establish footholds in unexpected areas
Visual Effect: Clusters of cells with occasional remote outbreaks

5. Controlled Chaos

Basic Concept: Combines deterministic growth with random elements
Random Element: Alternates between predictable and random phases
Rules:

First phase: Spread in a predictable pattern (like a spiral or cross)
Second phase: Random cell activation within a certain radius
Patterns repeat in cycles


Strategy: Offers both predictability and surprise elements
Visual Effect: Structured formations with chaotic boundaries

Implementation Considerations
Adding randomness to cellular automata will require:

A random number generator to determine probabilistic events
More complex rules for cell activation/conquest
Potentially tracking additional state information (like direction for the Snake pattern)
Balancing randomness vs. predictability for fair gameplay

The unpredictability will add excitement since players can't be 100% certain how their moves will play out, introducing elements of risk vs. reward to gameplay strategy.
