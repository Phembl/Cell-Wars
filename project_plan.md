# Cell Wars - Project Plan

## Game Components

### 1. UI Components
- Player portraits
- Move selection buttons (What information is needed?)
- Game grid/battlefield
- Turn indicator
- Score display
- Font

### 2. Grid System
- Cell representation
- Cell state tracking (neutral, player 1, player 2)
- Visual rendering

### 3. Player System
- Player data (name, color, score)
- Move set management
- Define different moves
- Turn management

### 4. Cellular Automata
- Different move patterns
- Rules for cell conquest
- Animation system

### 5. Networking
- Client-server architecture
- Game state synchronization
- Player connection handling

## Class Structure

1. **Grid Class**
   - Manages the grid of cells
   - Handles cell state changes
   - Renders the grid

2. **Player Class**
   - Stores player information
   - Manages available moves
   - Tracks score

3. **Move Class**
   - Defines different move types
   - Contains parameters for cellular automata

4. **CellularAutomaton Class**
   - Base class for different automaton patterns
   - Handles evolution of cell patterns

5. **GameManager Class**
   - Controls game flow
   - Manages turns
   - Updates game state

6. **NetworkManager Class**
   - Handles client-server communication
   - Synchronizes game state
   - Manages connections
